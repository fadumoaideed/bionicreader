# Text Processor Implementation Plan

## 1. Basic Implementation

- [ ] Simple word parser/tokeniser

  - Basic word boundary detection
    - Split on whitespace (\s+)
    - Remove/separate basic punctuation (.,!?)
    - Handle common ASCII characters
    - Edge Cases:
    - Multiple consecutive spaces
    - Leading/trailing whitespace
    - Mixed punctuation ("hello!?")
    - Apostrophes in contractions
    - Hyphens in compound words
      -Unicode word boundaries
    - Special characters
    - Language-specific rules
    - Preserving original spacing

- [ ] Core bold calculator

  - Implement basic word length to bold chars mapping
  - Handle common English word lengths (3-8 chars)
  - Simple linear calculation

- [ ] Basic text processor
  - Single-threaded processing
  - In-memory operation
  - Basic string manipulation

## 2. Intermediate Features

- [ ] Enhanced tokenization

  - Proper whitespace preservation
  - Smart punctuation handling
  - Handle common special characters
  - Basic Unicode support

- [ ] Improved bold calculator

  - Optimize calculation for performance
  - Handle edge cases (very short/long words)
  - Configurable bold patterns

- [ ] Better processing
  - Basic streaming support
  - Buffer management
  - Basic error handling

## 3. Advanced Features

- [ ] Advanced text handling

  - Full Unicode support
  - Complex punctuation rules
  - Handle all whitespace patterns
  - Empty line preservation

- [ ] Performance optimizations
  - Parallel processing
  - Memory mapping for large files
  - Buffer preallocation
  - String interning for repeated words

## Performance Goals

- Initial version: Process 1MB text < 500ms
- Optimized version: Process 1MB text < 100ms
- Memory usage < 2x input size
- Streaming mode: Constant memory usage

## Benchmarking (After Basic Implementation)

- [ ] Set up criterion.rs
- [ ] Create benchmark suite
  - Small texts (< 1KB)
  - Medium texts (1KB - 1MB)
  - Large texts (> 1MB)
- [ ] Profile memory usage
- [ ] Performance comparison between versions

## Where to Start

1. Begin with the basic word tokenizer - this is your foundation
2. Implement the simple bold calculator
3. Create basic text processor that combines both
4. Add tests for core functionality
5. Only after basic version works, move to intermediate features

Other things to do:

- Link tracking to see which output is most popular
- Capcha protection
- Rate limiting
- User feedback modal
- User credentials for larger files (subscription model)
- User feedback
- API security
